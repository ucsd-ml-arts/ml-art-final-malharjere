# Final Project

Malhar Jere, mjjere@ucsd.edu


## Abstract Proposal

FIRST STEP: Write up a description (in the form of an abstract) of what you will revisit for your final project. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept and approach. What are your desired creative goals? How are you expanding on something we covered in the class? How will you present your work next Wednesday in the final project presentations? 

For my final project I wanted to create a new technique to create visual art from neural networks inspired by chaos theory, which produces incredible and complex visuals using simple mathematical equations. My desired creative goal is to create a technique that can generate images with some artistic quality using simple operations involving the gradients of the outputs of neural networks with respect to their inputs.

## Model/Data

I used pre-trained models (VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet18) to generate my art images. The file "elephant.png" is used as a standalone example to generate art from that particular image.

## Code

I only have 1 file, which is final_project.ipynb that contains everything required to generate the art images I wanted.

## Results

I added a lot of images (JPEG and PNG files) generated using my techniques.
